This application is:
- a place to
  - promote creativity in education
  - serve as a resource for educators
  - build fun tools
- my portfolio
    
I want more than just another resume website. I want to embed creativity and functionality into everything I do, so I'm making my resume functional.

## Libraries and Starter Code Used
The front end is developed in ReactJS.

I used Material Kit 2 by Creative Tim as my UI code, which I am modifying to fit my needs. https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit/ All copyright is maintained throughout the source code.
